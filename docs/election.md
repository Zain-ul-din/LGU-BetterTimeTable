### Election Phase

Since this project is no longer maintained by the creators of this project. 
we believe the core moderators should come from the community, and be elected by the community itself through popular vote. 
We hold regular elections to determine who these community moderators will be.

Please participate in the moderator elections by ranking the candidates.
